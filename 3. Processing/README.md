### Threat Intelligence Platforms Free / Open-Source

## [OpenCTI](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti)

OpenCTI is a comprehensive open-source platform for managing cyber threat intelligence. Key features include:
Based on STIX2 standards for structuring data
Graphical visualization of threat data and relationships
Automated workflows for data analysis and correlation
Integration with external tools like MISP and MITRE ATT&CK
Supports various data types including IoCs, TTPs, and threat actors
Offers both API and web interface access
OpenCTI excels in its ability to handle complex relationships between threat data and provide advanced analytics. However, it may have a steeper learning curve due to its comprehensive nature.

## [Yeti](https://yeti-platform.io/)
Yeti is a more lightweight open-source platform focused on organizing and enriching threat intelligence. Key features include:
Simple web interface and API for data management
Automatic enrichment of observables (e.g., domain resolution, IP geolocation)
Supports various data types including IoCs and TTPs
Visualization of relationships between threats
Integration with external feeds and tools
Yeti is praised for its user-friendly interface and ease of use, making it a good choice for smaller teams or those new to threat intelligence platforms.

## [MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)](https://www.misp-project.org/)
MISP is a mature and widely-used open-source threat intelligence platform. Key features include:
Extensive sharing capabilities between organizations
Support for a wide range of IoCs and threat data
Automated correlation of attributes
Integration with various security tools and feeds
Large community and extensive documentation
MISP is known for its robust sharing features and large user community, but may be more complex to set up and manage compared to some other options.

## [TheHive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive)
TheHive is an open-source security incident response platform with threat intelligence capabilities. Key features include:
Case management for security incidents
Integration with MISP for threat intelligence
Customizable dashboards and templates
Collaboration features for security teams
TheHive is particularly strong in incident response workflows but may be less focused on pure threat intelligence management compared to other platforms.
In summary, OpenCTI offers advanced analytics and visualization but may be more complex, Yeti provides a user-friendly experience for basic threat intelligence needs, MISP excels in information sharing and community features, while TheHive focuses on incident response with integrated threat intelligence capabilities. The choice between these platforms depends on your specific needs, team size, and existing security infrastructure.
