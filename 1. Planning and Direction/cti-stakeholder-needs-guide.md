# Identifying Cyber Threat Intelligence Stakeholders and Needs

As a cyber threat intelligence manager building a new CTI team, it's crucial to identify the right stakeholders and understand the organization's unique threat intelligence requirements. This guide will help you navigate this process.

## Identifying Potential CTI Stakeholders

Potential CTI stakeholders are individuals or teams that can benefit from threat intelligence or contribute to its creation. They may include:

1. **Incident Response Team**: They require timely and actionable intelligence to investigate, contain, and remediate security incidents effectively.

2. **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: SOC analysts need up-to-date threat indicators, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to detect and respond to threats.

3. **Vulnerability Management Team**: They benefit from intelligence on emerging vulnerabilities, exploit trends, and patch priorities to manage risk effectively.

4. **Risk Management and Compliance**: They require strategic intelligence on threat actors, their motivations, and potential business impact to inform risk assessments and compliance decisions.

5. **Executive Leadership**: CISOs and other executives need high-level, strategic intelligence to understand the threat landscape, make informed decisions, and communicate with the board and external stakeholders.

6. **Application and Infrastructure Teams**: They can leverage intelligence to design and implement secure systems, prioritize security controls, and stay ahead of evolving threats.

7. **Legal and HR Departments**: They may require intelligence support for insider threat investigations, digital forensics, and legal proceedings.

8. **Business Units**: Specific business units or functions (e.g., finance, intellectual property) may have unique intelligence needs based on their risk profile and critical assets.

To identify stakeholders:
- Review the organizational chart and identify teams or individuals with security-related responsibilities.
- Conduct interviews or surveys to understand each team's role, objectives, and challenges.
- Attend cross-functional meetings to observe information flows and decision-making processes.
- Engage with leadership to understand strategic priorities and concerns.

## Assessing Threat Intelligence Needs

Once you have identified potential stakeholders, the next step is to assess their specific threat intelligence needs. This involves understanding the types of decisions they make, the risks they manage, and the information gaps they face.

1. **Engage stakeholders**: Schedule meetings or workshops with each stakeholder group to discuss their roles, objectives, and pain points. Ask open-ended questions to uncover their intelligence needs.

2. **Map intelligence needs to stakeholder goals**: Identify how threat intelligence can support each stakeholder's goals and objectives. For example:
   - SOC analysts need tactical intelligence to detect and investigate threats.
   - Executives need strategic intelligence to make risk-based decisions and allocate resources.

3. **Identify intelligence gaps**: Assess the current state of threat intelligence in the organization. Identify gaps or areas where stakeholders lack the necessary information to make informed decisions.

4. **Prioritize intelligence requirements**: Based on the stakeholder feedback and identified gaps, prioritize the most critical and impactful intelligence requirements. Consider factors such as risk reduction, operational efficiency, and strategic alignment.

5. **Develop an intelligence collection plan**: Define the sources, methods, and processes for collecting and analyzing the required intelligence. This may include external feeds, security vendors, open-source intelligence (OSINT), and internal telemetry.

6. **Establish feedback loops**: Create mechanisms for stakeholders to provide ongoing feedback on the relevance, timeliness, and quality of the intelligence they receive. Use this feedback to refine and improve your intelligence products and services.

By following this process, you can build a strong foundation for your CTI team that aligns with the organization's needs and delivers high-impact intelligence to key stakeholders.
