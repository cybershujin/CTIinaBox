# Planning and Direction Phase

Although it is always emphasized that the CTI Lifecycle is a continuous loop, with Planning and Direction step being part of a circle that is ongoing, as the saying goes "We all have to start somewhere".

Therefore this project attempts to break the Planning and Direction guidance into two sections, a "Getting a CTI program started from scratch" and guidance on activities that will be a part of the Planning and Direction activities involved in your ongoing CTI lifecycle such as incorporating feedback from stakeholders.

The planning phase of the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) lifecycle is foundational, setting the stage for targeted and effective intelligence activities. This phase determines the scope, objectives, and direction of the entire CTI process, ensuring that intelligence efforts are aligned with organizational needs and cybersecurity goals. The planning phase encompasses several key steps, including the development of intelligence requirements and the incorporation of insights gained from the feedback stage of the previous CTI cycle. Here’s a detailed instructional description of these processes:

### 1. **Define Organizational Objectives**

The initial step in the planning phase is to understand and articulate the broader organizational objectives that the CTI efforts aim to support. These objectives could range from protecting critical assets and ensuring compliance with regulations, to enabling informed decision-making and enhancing incident response capabilities. Clear organizational objectives help in defining specific, actionable intelligence requirements.

### 2. **Develop Intelligence Requirements**

Intelligence requirements are specific questions or information needs that, when answered, will help the organization meet its security objectives. This step involves:

- **Prioritizing Assets:** Identify and prioritize the organization’s critical assets, systems, and data that require protection. Understanding what needs to be protected helps focus the intelligence efforts.
- **Threat Modeling:** Conduct threat modeling to identify potential adversaries, their capabilities, intentions, and the methods they might use. This helps in defining the types of intelligence needed.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Engage with key stakeholders across the organization to gather their input on information gaps, perceived threats, and security concerns. This ensures that the intelligence requirements are comprehensive and aligned with various organizational perspectives.

### 3. **Incorporate Feedback Insights**

The feedback stage from the previous CTI cycle provides valuable insights into the effectiveness and relevance of the intelligence produced. Incorporating these insights involves:

- **Evaluating Feedback:** Systematically evaluate feedback from intelligence consumers and stakeholders regarding the accuracy, timeliness, relevance, and actionable nature of the intelligence provided.
- **Adjusting Requirements:** Based on the feedback, refine existing intelligence requirements or develop new ones to address gaps, emerging threats, or changing organizational priorities. This may involve re-prioritizing assets or threat models based on new information.
- **Enhancing Collaboration:** Strengthen mechanisms for ongoing communication and collaboration with stakeholders to ensure continuous alignment of intelligence efforts with organizational needs.

### 4. **Documentation and Communication**

Document the defined intelligence requirements, prioritization criteria, and any adjustments made based on feedback. Communicate the updated plan and objectives to all relevant parties involved in the CTI process. This ensures clarity, alignment, and accountability throughout the intelligence lifecycle.

### 5. **Continuous Improvement**

Treat the planning phase as a cyclical process, not a one-time event. Regularly revisit and revise the planning documents in response to new feedback, changes in the threat landscape, or shifts in organizational priorities. This continuous improvement mindset ensures that CTI efforts remain agile and responsive to the dynamic nature of cyber threats.

By meticulously following these steps in the planning phase, organizations can establish a solid foundation for their CTI lifecycle, ensuring that their intelligence efforts are both strategic and adaptable to the evolving cyber threat environment.
